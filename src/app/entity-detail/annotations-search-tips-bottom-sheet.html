  You can do many fancy things when search for annotations
</h3>

<p>
  When you first land to this page, by default, the root annotations
  in your group / class / My Library will show up. A root annotation
  is the starting point of a thread a user made on a document.
</p>

<h4 class="text text-info">
  The obvious
</h4>
<p>
  Obviously, you can search annotations by keywords.
  Type the keywords in the search bar and hit enter.
</p>

<h4 class="text text-info">
  The not-so-obvious
</h4>

<p>
  <b>Wild card search</b>
  If you want to see every annotation created in your group / class
  or My Library, type: <br>
  <code>
    *
  </code>
  <br>
  in the search bar and hit enter. This will give you every annotation
  (root, responses, nested-responses...).
  <br>

<p>
  You can append some filter options to your keywords
  to limit the search scope.
  <br>
  <b>Only see annotations created by certain user</b>

  For example, if you want
  to search for annotations with keywords "Tower of Babel"
  <b>created by yourself</b>. Then, type
  <br>
  <code>
    Tower of Babel | --creator-name "your username"
  </code>
  Likewise, if for some reason you want to see annotations
  with keywords "Tower of Babel" created by another user
  in your class or group. They, type
  <br>
  <code>
    Tower of Bable | --creator-name "another user's username"
  </code>
  <br>

  <b>Only see root annotations</b>
  If you just want to see root annotations with the keywords
  "Tower of Babel". Type: <br>
  <code>
    Tower of Babel | --root-only
  </code>

  <br>
  <b>Aggregation</b>
  You can use --creator-name and --root-only filter together.
  For example: if you type: <br>
  <code>
    Tower of Babel | --creator-name "Alice" --root-only
  </code>
  you will see root annotations created by Alice (if she is in your group),
  with the keywords "Tower of Babel".
  <br>
  If you type:<br>
  <code>
    * | --creator-name "Alice" --root-only
  </code>
  you will see every root annotation created by Alice.
