1. Meeting with Fadil Santosa:
1.1 Ask Fadil to connect me with conferences, people can post questions about
conference presentation. If they need to ask more refined questions, after the
talk, they can post it on my platform


2. Meeting with Amit Chourasia(data scientist):
"people share data on seedMe, but they don't really use the discussion functionality"

"when researcher asks a question, they want an answer, they don't want discussion"

"when you email somebody, he or she has more obligation to respond, but if you just post
a question on a platform, experts don't feel the obligation to respond"

"Authors will very likely to respond"

"collaboration with established player is a good idea"(established players means
established journal article publishers. For them, my service can be some add-ons,
vitamin not medicine)

"researchers only have the money to buy things that are absolutely necessary"

Amit mentioned some interesting concept: obligation to respond to questions.
"If your adviser email me a question, I will respond, but the converse might not
be true"
